`Q 1 Review a mock event created by someone else.`

I reviewed a `Project Badge Application` by Esther [link](https://github.com/badging/project-diversity-and-inclusion/pull/1)

I did what I would describe as a mock peer review and left the comments in the PR (highlighted in the *qoute* below) outlining my findings. From my understanding D&I badging reviews ought to be peer reviews this is done so as to allow sharing of ideas within the community so as to collectively improve on diversity and inclusion. The  D&I Badging docs currently do not provide a review guide/specification.
>My name is Jacqueline Binya. I am a core contributor to the [YY-Search](https://google.com).
>These are some of my recommendations after going through your application:
>To address
> `How welcoming, responsive, respectful are interactions even on hot topics of debate? What is the diversity of voices speaking/being heard?` and `How well does the project issue tracker setup to invite new contributors, skilled contributors, non-technical contributors?`
>* At YY-Search we have a contributing guide which includes a link to a Code of Conduct. The `Contributing Guide` is quite useful in on-boarding contributors of different levels of expertise to the project. Consequently we are then able to attract a more diverse pool of contributors. The Contributing Guide is  written in an easy to understand manner and we made an effort to avoid use of unnecessary technical jargon. Its content includes a general overview of the project, installation and set up guides as well as as basic contributing instructions.
>*  In the Contributing Guide the participants are explicitly advised to read the Code of Conduct and make sure they understand it before contributing. This has to some extent sanitized our communication channels, as in the Code of Conduct consequences in failing to comply are stipulated.

I therefore issue a passing badge for the project: <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/038a8f888ac3ff52e6be97529274d42705d0d075/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f44253236492d50617373696e672d70617373696e673f7374796c653d666c61742d737175617265266c6162656c436f6c6f723d353833353836266c6f676f3d646174613a696d6167652f7376672b786d6c3b6261736536342c50484e325a7942325a584a7a61573975505349784c6a4569494868746247357a50534a6f644852774f693876643364334c6e637a4c6d39795a7938794d4441774c334e325a794967646d6c6c64304a76654430694d434177494449314d4341794e54416950676f38634746306143426d615778735053496a4d554d35516b51324969426b50534a4e4f5463754d5377304f53347a597a45344c5459754e79777a4e7934344c5459754f4377314e5334354c5441754d6d77784e7934314c544d774c6a4a6a4c5449354c5445794c6a4d744e6a45754f4330784d6934794c546b774c6a67734d43347a54446b334c6a45734e446b754d336f694c7a344b50484268644767675a6d6c7362443069497a5a42517a64434f5349675a443069545445354e4334324c444d794c6a684d4d5463334c6a49734e6a4e6a4d5451754f4377784d69347a4c4449304c6a63734d6a6b754e5377794e7934354c4451344c6a566f4d7a51754f554d794d7a59754d6977344d4334794c4449784f5334354c4455784c6a63734d546b304c6a59734d7a49754f486f694c7a344b50484268644767675a6d6c736244306949304a474f554e444f5349675a443069545449774e4334354c44457a4f533430597930334c6a6b734e444d754f5330304f5334354c44637a4c546b7a4c6a67734e6a55754d574d744d544d754f4330794c6a55744d6a59754f4330344c6a59744d7a63754e5330784e793432624330794e6934344c4449794c6a514b43574d304e6934324c44517a4c6a51734d5445354c6a55734e4441754f5377784e6a49754f5330314c6a646a4d5459754e5330784e7934334c4449334c5451774c6a49734d7a41754d5330324e433479534449774e4334356569497650676f38634746306143426d615778735053496a52445978524456474969426b50534a4e4e5455754e6977784e6a55754e6b4d7a4e5334354c44457a4d5334344c44517a4c6a4d734f4467754f4377334d7934784c44597a4c6a564d4e5455754e79777a4d793479517a63754e5377324f5334344c5451754d6977784d7a63754e4377794f4334344c4445344f4577314e5334324c4445324e5334326569497650676f384c334e325a7a344b" alt="CHAOSS Passing Badge" />
