`Q 0 Submit a non-existent project to understand the workflow.`

I submitted a mock event `VueGotham-2020`, and opened a [PR](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/pull/4).

These were my findings:
* I initially had problems trying to figure out how to apply for a badge, the screenshots below explain how that came about as well as my recommendations to address the issue.

* After I figured out that the instructions on how to apply for an event badge where in a link called [README](https://github.com/badging/diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/README.md#applying-for-badges). I was able to follow the badge application process seamlessly. The questions asked not only ascertain whether an event meets CHAOSS metrics but they offer what I would describe as a checklist for anyone who wants to ensure that their events are inclusive and diverse.
* I stumbled upon this gem of a resource called the [Diversity Charter](https://diversitycharter.org/) it contains information that might be useful as a reference and  in crafting a submission criteria for events. I think we have a rare opportunity to impose an opinionated standard for diverse and inclusive open source tech event through formulating a submission criteria. The submission criteria may include requirements for an events website where data on diversity and inclusiveness is shown amongst other things. I believe that having such a submission standard would safeguard transparency of the application and review processes as well as ensure that all information submitted is accurate.
* Lastly I would like to point out that it would be really nice if we had an in `progress`  and `complete` labels for pull requests during the application phase.
This would help differentiate PRs which are still in progress and those which complete and ready for reviews. Additionally this would put contributors who are making incremental contributions at ease.
