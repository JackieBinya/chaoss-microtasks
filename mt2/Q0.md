`Q 0 Provide a brief summary of the submission and review process.`

>After reviewing the workflow process and all of the moving parts that create it, provide your idea of how this workflow can be best explained. This task is focused to the submission and review workflow of the Badging Program.

The CHAOSS focus areas which implement D&I Bagding are Project Diversity and Event Diversity.The D&I Badging workflow takes place on GitHub in the open. the CHAOSS D&I Badging workgroup created two repos [Project Badging](https://github.com/badging/project-diversity-and-inclusion) and  [Event Bagding](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion) .The prospective applicants are provided with information on how to apply for a badge. This is a two-step process which starts with appending either an event or project in a *events* or *projects* table in the corresponding repos of entities. The table is used to showcase the badging status of either events or projects for which badging applications were made. Because of the undelining git workflow once applicants append their entities to the tables i.e make changes, they can open pull requests so as to submit their changes. The PRs opened have an embedded template which is a form the applicants are expected to fill out in Markdown. The questions asked in the form are used to assess if the applicants are compliant to D&I  metrics. So far yet no review guides or specifications have been stipulated.
